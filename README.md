[anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagrams_(game)) is a multi-player word game played using the following letter distributions:
    2: J, K, Q, X, Z
    3: B, C, F, H, M, P, V, W, Y
    4: G
    5: L
    6: D, S, U
    8: N
    9: T, R
    11: O
    12: I
    13: A
    18: E

The game begins with 3 tiles facing up and the rest facing down. On each turn, a tile is flipped. Players may then:
1) form a word entirely from the center tiles
2) 'steal' a word from another player's list by anagramming the word (and changing the root meaning)
3) 'defend' a word from their own list by anagramming the word (and changing the root meaning)

Words must be 4+ letters long. Each word is worth its length minus three points.

When the facedown tiles are gone, and either the center tiles are gone or all players agree there are no further moves to be made, the game ends. Highest score wins.
